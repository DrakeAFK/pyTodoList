# pyTodoList

 Terminal based todo list written in Python

 This is my first Python app

 Run the app in your terminal from the project directory with `python app.py`

 Follow the instructions to `View Tasks` `Add Task` `Delete Task` or `Exit`

 The app will generate a `tasks.txt` file in the project directory of the created task list and update everytime a task is deleted or appended to the task list
